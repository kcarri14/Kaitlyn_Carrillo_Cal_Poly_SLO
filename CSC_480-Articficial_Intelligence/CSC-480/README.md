# CSC 480 Porject: Connect 4 AI

## Set Up
- Make a new python virtual environment and activate it (optional)
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run `uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000` to start the backend 
- In a new terminal window navigate to the `connect-4-ai` directory
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev` to start the frontend


## 1- Project Description.
- For our project we are making a Connect 4 bot that uses logic and the state of the board to make the best decision. 
- We will have different modes so the bot can be harder or easier to beat. 
- The input will be the state of the board and the output will be making a next move or determining if it is a win, loss, or draw. 
- This bot will be logic-based.
## 2- Data. 
- Rules of Connect 4 which will be obtained by the internet
- Strategies for Connect 4 
## 3- Platform. 
- We will have a logic-based environment where the agent will be given the rules and strategies on how to play Connect 4. 
- The user interface will be web-based where we will be using React and FAST API for front and backend. 
## 4- Implementation plan. 
- We will have a logic-based environment where the agent will be given the rules and strategies on how to play Connect 4. 
- The user interface will be web-based where we will be using React and FAST API for front and backend. 
- The website will consist of a difficulty level, game board and win/lose score. 
## 5- Testing plan. 
- We will test the outcome including the winner and number of moves taken to win against a range we expect for each level of difficulty for our model. 
- We will test it by playing with the bot on the different difficulty levels and also evaluating its strategy based on our own. 
- We will be playing and seeing if the moves are random or if they are strategic by setting up different scenarios. 
## 6- Future expansion. 
- Future expansions could include building different grid shapes, having a defensive and offensive model, and implementing different game modes similar to Connect 4. 
- Other expansions could be multi-player instead of just two player or allowing coins to go on different sides of the board instead of just the top.
